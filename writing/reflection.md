# Structured Types

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the TODO markers inside of this file and
either remove or rewrite the prompts. When you are finished with this reflection
it should contain professional writing that is suitable for publishing. That
includes removing this paragraph!

## Add Your Name Here

## 1. Program Output

TODO: Run the following commands and provide the output in fenced code blocks.

- `python compute-tuple-intersection.py`
- `python perform-apply-to-each.py`

TODO: Make an H3 heading for **each** command you used that identifies what
each command uniquely demonstrates compared to the others.

## 2. Program Understanding

### Understanding Function Signatures

TODO: Explain every component of the following function signatures to
demonstrate your understanding.

- `def compute_intersection(tuple_one: Tuple[Any, ...], tuple_two: Tuple[Any, ...]) -> Tuple[Any, ...]:`
- `def apply_to_each(values: List[int], function: Callable) -> None`

### Understanding Intersections

TODO: Why does the `compute_intersection` function return different outputs
depending on its input order? Answer to demonstate your understanding.

### Understanding None Return Type 

TODO: Why does the `apply_to_each` function not need to return a list?

### Understanding Higher-Order Functions

TODO: Why is `apply_to_each` a higher order function, and why would this
be useful?

## 3. Professional Development

TODO: Are you able to write well-formatted code and markdown without linters
like pymarkdown and ruff? Why or why not?
